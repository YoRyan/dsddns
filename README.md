# dsddns

DsDDNS is the Dual-Stack Dynamic DNS client. In comparison to other dynamic DNS clients available on the Internet, including some others written in Go, dsddns features:

- First-class support for IPv6, including the ability to update multiple subdomains within a dynamically allocated prefix.
- Support for managing multiple domains across multiple accounts and services.
- A YAML configuration format that supports the DRY ("don't repeat yourself") principle.
